~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NOTES/TODO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-Any reason we're displaying 'Pos.' in the queue? This seems unecessary.
-make student question optionally visible to other students?
-set Announcements box at constant size (instead of growing/shrinking) and use scroll bar when necessary
-on All Classes page, color code enroll and leave options (e.g. Enroll=green, Leave=red)
-automatic location generation when entering queue
-TA/faculty toggle abilities (e.g. does logging out remove you from queue)
-TA/faculty ability to freeze queue so no one new can enter
-Have different background colors for TAs
-Have CIS handle authentication
Fixed: -Logout on main queue page doesn't go to login page
-Spinners or progress/waiting indicators for slow loads
-Success is falsely returned when a student (or TA) removes self (or another student) from a non-existent class.
-Should logging out remove you from all queues?
-main queue page should display name, not username
Not a Problem: -In our DB courses table, does the name need to include the dept and course num? Is this redundant?
Not a Problem: -Dequeuing a student from a queue they’re not in returns success. Problem? 
Not a Problem: -Removing a course that a student’s not enrolled in returns success. Problem?
Not a Problem: -Adding a course that a student’s already enrolled in returns success. Problem?
Fixed: -Conversely to the 3 notes above, putting a TA on duty for a class they’re already on duty for returns failure.
What convention should we use? 
-Switch NATURAL JOIN to INNER JOIN...ON. Apparently natural joins are more susceptible to bugs and are bad practice.
-Lock navbar in place when scrolling
-Consider using web sockets and events so server can push changes instead clients pulling from server every 5 seconds
-TA/faculty ability to delete announcements

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ EMAIL FROM ERIN PARKER ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Daniel,
In a meeting with some of my TAs this morning, the topic of the TA call queue came up and I took the opportunity to get
some ideas from them on what they would like to see in a new app.  Here are some notes.  Feel free to ask about anything
that does not make sense.

-Ensure that only students currently enrolled in the class can sign in (with an access code or something). It doesn't
happen much, but occasionally students from the wrong class sign in.

-Include a utility for TAs to directly message students currently in the queue (collectively or individually). This can be
useful if a student's location is incorrect, or to warn that TA hours are ending soon.

-(This is a bit specific to CS at the U, but...)  Have a map of the CADE lab to show where students in the queue are sitting,
so the TA can locate them quickly.

-Include push notifications to the TAs on duty for when a student enters the queue.  During slow times, when the queue is empty,
some TAs are late noticing that a student has entered.

-Allow a TA-supplied list of common issues/questions for students to choose from when entering the queue, to make it easier to
answer for a group of students.

Done: -When students enter the queue, have a "subject" line to fill (in addition to name and location).

-Allow TAs to reorder the queue and undo removing a student.

-Capture a history/activity log for a session, for TAs and instructors to look at later and assess things like how long a TA is
spending with students, which students use the queue most often, etc.
